4. Variables
Variables are used to store data values in memory.
Syntax:
varable_name = value
Examples:
x = 10
y = "Python"
z = 3.14
Python is dynamically typed, meaning you do not need to declare the type of a variable explicitly.

5. Data Types
Each value in Python has a data type. Python automatically assigns the type.
Common Data Types:
Type	Description	Example
int	Whole numbers	10, -5
float	Decimal numbers	3.14, -0.5
str	Text (string)	"Hello"
bool	True or False	True, False
None	Represents no value	None
Example:
x = 10
print(type(x))  # <class 'int'>

6. List
A list is an ordered, mutable collection that can store multiple values, including different data types.
Syntax:
my_list = [1, 2, 3, "Python", True]
Examples:
numbers = [10, 20, 30]
numbers[1] = 50
print(numbers)  # [10, 50, 30]

7. Tuple
A tuple is similar to a list, but it is immutable (cannot be changed after creation).
Syntax:
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
Example:
coordinates = (10, 20)
# coordinates[0] = 5  # Error: tuples are immutable

8. Set
A set is an unordered collection of unique values. It does not allow duplicate elements.
Syntax:
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4}
print(my_set)  # {1, 2, 3, 4}
Properties:
•	Unordered
•	Mutable
•	No duplicates
9. Mutable vs Immutable
Mutable Objects (can be changed):
•	List
•	Set
•	Dictionary
Immutable Objects (cannot be changed):
•	int
•	float
•	str
•	tuple
•	bool
Example:
x = [1, 2, 3]
x[0] = 10  # Allowed

y = (1, 2, 3)
# y[0] = 10  # Error
