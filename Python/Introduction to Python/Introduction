1.Introduction
Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language created by Guido van
Rossum and released in 1991. It is known for its simplicity, readability, and wide range of
applications.
Why Python?
•	Easy to learn and read
•	Large standard library
•	Strong community support
•	Used in web development, data science, automation, AI/ML, and more
Example:
print("Hello, World!")

2. Comments
Comments are notes written in the code that are ignored by the Python interpreter. They are used to explain code and improve readability.
Single-line comment:
x = 10  # This stores the value 10
Multi-line comment (using triple quotes):
"""
This is a multi-line comment
used for documentation
"""

3. Indentation
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. In Python, indentation is mandatory and is used to define blocks of code.
Example:
if 5 > 2:
    print("Five is greater than two")
Rules:
•	Use consistent spacing (usually 4 spaces)
•	All statements in the same block must have the same indentation level
